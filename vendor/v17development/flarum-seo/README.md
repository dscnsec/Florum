## How do the results look like in Google?
Potential it could look like this, after Google reindex your site. This could take a while before Google or any other crawler does this. The following screenshots are in Dutch, but you get the concept:

## How long will changes take effect?
It depends. Recrawling can take a few days, up to a few weeks until most of your results are updated. Use the [Flagrow Sitemap](https://discuss.flarum.org/d/14941-flagrow-sitemap) to let Google know what discussions there are on your forum. You may speed it up by manually update a search result Google via the [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console/about), but that is no gurantee that the search result will be updated directly.
